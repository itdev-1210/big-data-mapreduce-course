### Proposed Change to the Graduate Bulletin

Today, more than 80% of useful data is unstructured. 
Most of the Businesses now wants to store, process 
and analyze these huge datasets economically and 
predictably to solve numerous problems - find new 
markets, reduce risks, improve healthcare and many 
such applications.  Todays useful data has velocity, 
variety and volume. Old SQL databases do not scale-out 
and are not fit to handle the new requirements. Term 
Big Data was coined to solve the emerging data problems. 
This course is about Big Data and its role in carrying 
out modern business intelligence for actionable insight 
to address new business needs. This course is a lab led 
and open source software rooted course. Students will 
learn the fundamentals of MapReduce, Spark framework, 
NoSQL databases, PySpark, and Amazon Athena. The class 
will focus on storage, process and analysis aspects 
of Big Data. Students will use Spark cluster and 
MapReduce fundamentals to solve big data problems (such
as ETL, transformations and analytics, and basics of
machine learning and streaming).
